## 🧪 Password Strength Results

| Password         | Score (%) | Crack Time           | Notes                            |
|------------------|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|
| `vishnu123`      | 24%       | < 1 second            | Weak and predictable             |
| `v!shnu@321`     | 54%       | 2 hours               | Improved with symbols            |
| `V1$hnU#19@2K`   | 88%       | 34 years              | Strong complexity                |
| `India#2024isGreat`| 75%     | 6 million years       | Good length and memorability     |
| `T8$w#9Qe@1Rz!`  | 95%       | 347 billion years     | Excellent random password        |

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

1. **What makes a password strong?**  
   Length (12+), complexity (symbols, cases, digits), unpredictability, and avoiding personal info.

2. **What are common password attacks?**  
   Brute force, dictionary attack, credential stuffing, phishing.

3. **Why is password length important?**  
   Longer passwords increase the number of combinations, making brute-force attacks impractical.

4. **What is a dictionary attack?**  
   An attacker uses a list of known/common passwords to try and crack accounts.

5. **What is multi-factor authentication?**  
   A second layer of security that requires another proof like OTP, app approval, biometrics, etc.

6. **How do password managers help?**  
   They generate and store complex passwords securely, reducing reuse and simplifying login.

7. **What are passphrases?**  
   Easy-to-remember phrases like `Sunset#Over$Mountains@2025`, combining length and simplicity.

8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**  
   Using names, reusing passwords, short/simple passwords, using patterns like `abcd1234`.

## ✅ Conclusion
This task helped me understand what makes a password strong and how easily weak passwords can be cracked. I will now use longer and more secure passphrases and enable MFA wherever possible.
